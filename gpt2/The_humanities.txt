It[.] impossible to know whether the men who wrote the most well-known books and the most influential people in history, or the most influential people in the arts, ever lived. What we can do is to look at their lives to the extent that we can, and to give a sense to the richness of their creative capacity. What we can look at is not just the lives that matter to them. What we can do is to see them as a part of a larger human complex, the universe that we share with our children and with our grandchildren. This is not just a simple philosophical question. What we can do is explore the lives of these men in the study of the humanities.'' A generation ago, the British literary tradition and the American literary tradition were as intimately connected as

The humanities are a major source for our understanding of our cultures, our cultures' culture, and to this end the arts provide a powerful vehicle for understanding our culture. In our work with the artists and their art they have done, they have offered the community an opportunity to have their visions realized and to be part of a larger culture. In the humanities, the arts have always been as important a resource for the young person, to understand the complexity of the world as to how the world is built and how the cultural imagination is shaped by their work, to learn about the world and to connect with others who are not part of the experience. They have also been a major part in my work in the arts. They have been a critical force for the arts community to bring to life many of the important issues the arts bring to the world and to our culture.

The problem, however, is not that people cannot learn; it is that they cannot learn and they are not prepared to learn, at this very moment, to move forward. It is one thing to look for a specific idea in the present moment; it is quite another to look for a particular idea in the future. When we look ahead, there is a certain certainty that the future is far from predictable and that we must seek out a way forward that is not at all like a traditional, hierarchical, bureaucratic or bureaucratic process. We must seek a more holistic view of a society that is more like an ancient civilization. It is the duty of those who work in the fields and in the communities of the U_S, and in particular the American Indian community, to be clear on their future. We need to

The humanities provide an integral part of the humanities' teaching, research, learning and understanding that helps us better understand and develop our culture. They also provide us with an important way to shape ideas and values in our lives. The humanities can help us apply language to the contemporary world, and they can help us to understand and reflect on differences and other lives we live, work or live through. In the end, these resources are important. They could also provide us with a sense of self-consciousness, to help us to see the world through our unique perspectives. As a student of the humanities, I was blessed to hear people talk about the humanities during the past four years as a way to help them develop a new perspective on their lives and to learn how they can relate to others better. To that end, I would like to offer the following resources in the summer of 2009: 1) The

The university, in its first year, received some 400 applications and applications and, for the first time, received the $5. 33-billion it had set aside for its four full-time faculty members. The university[.] $2. 26 billion endowment is larger than the whole endowment in America, but its endowment is a fraction of the $3. 5 billion that went to the entire university. The foundation[.] largest fund, $40 million or so, is to be spread all over the world.

 at the time of the Great Depression, these were major sources of income for the university administration. Now, after more than 20 years of declining enrollment, the university has been unable to recover its footing. And the university[.] students are still struggling. The current recession, which began in July, has left students to work and travel around the country and on several Saturdays, they are going camping and traveling. It may be difficult for them to repay the debt. At the UAB campus, the debt has to be repaid at the end of each academic calendar year if the university is to be financially viable again as a major research university. Some students and alumni on campus are furious at what they see as a university that treats humanities as a career-endangering business rather than a full-time position to study the humanities. At least one of the reasons for the university[.] collapse is that its graduate students still have a small percentage of those who are pursuing a master[.] degree or a Ph.

There is an immense amount of literature to be used in the study of our human history. The first major book written on the history of our society is Arthur Schlesinger[.] ''The World Without a Nation,'' published in 1920 and first published in America, in which he was a political theorist and a journalist.

I think it[.] the_right decision for teachers in many cases, especially in the first four years of their teaching, as they move into their third year. We should not expect them to be part of the curriculum, because our system has a history of trying to make sure that our teaching practices are well grounded. There is no doubt that teachers and students are learning in ways that most Americans do not realize. They are being taught in ways that most Americans do not realize.

The decline of American culture, the report says, will be felt in the country, where there are no shortage of writers, scholars, artists or intellectuals - only a handful of whom have a literary voice. The report, which was prepared by scholars from the National Endowment for the Humanities in New_York City, is the most comprehensive effort to quantify culture in the U_S in more than a decade.

That trend has changed the way children see an appreciation of the importance of study. In a recent study, the Center for Labor Market Research at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and the University of Vermont examined a sampling of 9,000 families in a state with high unemployment. The study found that the percentage of those in the bottom quintile of the income distribution who are now able to attend college dropped, especially among students earning less than $20,000 in earnings. And among students who said they had completed six or more years of college by age 35, one in five had dropped out.

But there is one area where there is not one, one place where there is no standard for excellence in the humanities: the humanities. As a nation, we have not yet reached that point, but we are approaching a point that is not just in our education but the way our schools are built and the way our lives are organized and the way our teachers and their families are taught, the way they treat children, the way they talk to their friends and to their colleagues. We have not reached that point. But that is not an excuse either. We have reached a point where we have, I believe, reached a point where the best part of the humanities program is a program that is a commitment to excellence.

But the Internet has not yet been well-supported by our colleges and universities in the U_S: The Pew Research Center has had many students, and a growing number of their parents, go online to view, search and study the humanities, particularly for children. Thus far more than 1,200 high-quality college and university computer programs have been built and funded, and in the next five years more than 70,000 colleges and universities will have a presence in the Internet.

 have been left off the table until recently as well. Many people, even those with degrees in the arts, believe that the humanities constitute a vital part of the humanities, for they are vital to a culture that teaches us to appreciate it and for which we have been very eager to help it. But in the past two hundred years, humanities have also been neglected by our students, and there has been a real threat to the humanities in the U_S from the power of the media and the power of individual cultural works. The last time we watched PBS was to a great extent a year or so ago. So when I talk about literature, I want to talk about the humanities. I am not making the same kind of claim in the way that I did two decades ago when I was a senior lecturer in public affairs. I am not arguing with the same view of the humanities, the same perspective. I'm not trying to sell the philosophy of our culture as they are seen by many American kids

'I don't believe that science is going to solve the world problem,' he said. 'I have never said that.' What he means is not that scientists can't solve the world problems, he said, 'but that we can, through our arts and the humanities, and through our literature - and the music, and the films - that make a difference.'

In the course of my dissertation dissertation, I began to study the humanities as an elective. This was an elective taught by Dr. J. M. N. (Department of Philosophy, Ohio State University) and I was part of the team that was studying the relationship between the humanities and democracy. During the course of my dissertation, I was also a part of a group of students who were studying a classic French text called The Great Awakening, which was published in 1840 in France and was translated into English in 1849.

But if one does not grasp this and wants to become intellectually engaged in the debate about how the humanities should be taught, one must begin by working on one[.] own intellectual issues. There are, of course, many intellectual concerns and concerns of the academic humanities, and there are also many questions related to understanding the cultural and social past. Many of these issues are related to the cultural and ethical questions that have been raised about the humanities in recent decades. A number of these questions have been answered by a number of academic scholars, including Robert H. Wirth. In this article, I propose three new areas of inquiry and to help readers understand the importance of the humanities in the development of our understanding of the past, present and future. This is a very important topic for many of our readers, as well as for our colleagues at the New_York Public Library. We have three primary historical sources, which

''Art has a very important and important role in our lives,'' Mr. Lippincott said. ''It should be taught to all young people with a high school education at all expenses.'' ''It would be impossible to find anything in print at the moment,'' he said. ''If we were to have the money to print our newspapers, we would be in danger of losing our ability to have the arts or the arts and culture to drive good economic growth.'' ''Art is a medium to create a cultural life of discovery and imagination by giving people the possibility to experience the spirit of art with an imagination,'' Mr. Lippincott said. ''The arts are an

They're also in many ways, particularly with regard not only to their impact on our society but also to the world we live in. While this new era may not be complete for the most part, we are at a time when, for instance, the arts are on the decline, and we need to invest in supporting these activities to continue to help preserve the traditions that sustain our culture and to strengthen our culture[.] role in the world. In my written testimony we've highlighted the important need to maintain as these arts are, the vitality of our country[.] artistic culture to which this country owes a great debt. The arts should be part of our heritage, but they are also a way of life, one of our largest and most intimate social and economic problems. The arts serve a

The endowment, which is administered by the Treasury Department, helped the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities win the National Endowment for the Humanities' contract with The New_York University to establish a $500 million, three-year, non-profit, non-partisan program that would provide a $2. 5 billion endowment to support humanities education.

"We're all feeling like we're back from the dead, but I think we're beginning to recover from something I felt a little bit in the '60s," said Daniel Bock, one of the students who has been the target of hate mail. "We're feeling like we're back from the start of the '60s, but I feel a sense of optimism again, that there is hope in our country and that it[.] not just a question of one year, it[.] a question of the next year." "The more we do it to ourselves, the more we feel like we can turn things around," said the graduate student, Ramesh, a psychology student who has written, "We want to give back but we have to make it a lot harder to do it."

 have often been called "the core academic subject of American culture," but that might change in the next few years. "The humanities are an important part of learning in much of our college and university settings," said James F. Eberhart, the president and executive chairman, of the Center for American Education, a conservative think tank in Washington. "But they are also important in the lives of college and university students, students who are learning the traditional American way of life, and who are learning the 'modern' way of life. They are not the core subject of American culture. ''There is too much of a focus on the humanities,' '' he said. ''We are not trying to put students on a pedestal, but rather to connect the two." In the mid-20th century, colleges and universities faced a dilemma at a time when American society had lost its social imagination of civic citizenship, and its fascination with the creative and the social. Many believed that the humanities and the arts
======================================== SAMPLE 42 ========================================
 are not alone in this belief. While most students are eager to improve their academic performance, many still feel that they cannot solve the complex problems they face in the face of a changing society and a changing economy. "When students get to a certain place, they realize that it[.] their own fault, their own fault," said Mr. Smith. "Now we're having this debate about what[.] best for the environment? What[.] best for our country?" Mr. Smith is not alone in his fear, Mr. Smith said, in addressing a generation growing up in the 1970[.] and 80[.]. The debate was sparked by a recent study published in The American Scholar in the Arts by the Yale History Series on Education. The study, which examined the "culture and its impact on student achievement and college readiness," analyzed data from surveys, surveys, surveys, surveys, surveys and surveys, as well as evaluations of class outcomes.

 , the humanities have always been a powerful instrument for understanding the human spirit, and their role in American culture has been expanded since their inception. One of the most fundamental things we celebrate today, as we celebrate a second Sunday of Lent in October, is the great honor that people like Martin Luther King Jr., who spoke out against the Vietnam War for the last 11 years, now have -- have been giving us this magnificent chance to do so -- to express their profound sense of human life through the music of the Word. The great gift of music in American culture and the immense contributions that people like Martin Luther King and others have made to all the wonderful work that they've done -- all over this country -- in the search for meaning and meaning, and as we celebrate the third Sunday this month of Lent -- we also celebrate an extraordinary opportunity to listen to the words of the American poet, Martin Luther King.

But it also means a better understanding of politics. "I think it[.] time to move on from 'What Would Have Happened' to 'What If' and 'What What Now?' " asks Paul Goodman, a political historian at the University of Pennsylvania, who has been analyzing the American Revolution for many years and is a friend of George Will[.] "Who[.] Who in Washington" book. "I think the real problem in America today is to think of history as something that[.] written in stone, in a form that[.] already written in stone, on a page, and then see how it[.] written in stone." The question for Americans today, he says, is who can truly do the work? The answer, says Goodman, is that they can, in fact. While our

 are an important, valuable part of our culture, but we don't have to be concerned with just one discipline in one particular field. Students are already trained to know the history of the past and the meaning that it created, how it applies to the future, how it connects to past society, how it guides our cultural culture. The best of the past is now being taught by a future. If we wanted to have that history taught, we would need to be more engaged in it, and more effective in it. With more education, students become more interested in the past. As part of this new curriculum, we ask people with a history background to take a course on American history and culture. In response to a call from a school administrator at a recent community college to expand the curriculum for students from a new class, she asked, "Is this a good thing, the teacher feels like he[.] being a little bit too preachy?"

, like arts, are deeply concerned with human nature and their connection to it. But they are also concerned with the need to see nature through a lens that understands how human nature is affected by human history. Such an understanding may take the form of cultural studies, which are focused on the relationship between the past and the future, and their interactions with past and future history. For the humanities, this role may not be as important as it might be in the arts. For their own sake, their study of history is crucial for the humanities, both in its educational and cultural manifestations. In this respect, the work of Andrew Kline has been called to account, particularly for the recent history of American history, the humanities and the arts.

He is the author of "A Brief History of American Culture" (Penguin, $28. 95). "My main interest was in the history of the U_S," Gephardt said.

And if we cannot use them appropriately and responsibly, it may be because we have too much power. We need to address these issues through our own initiative and through a vigorous research program. You may be surprised to learn that the humanities are the second most important group of humanists. The humanities are a powerful part of our cultural heritage. They are also an important way of providing opportunities for young people to develop and grow in our world. In the past, the humanities have been a major vehicle for the development of people, but today we need a more diverse group, a more comprehensive set of institutions and a more diverse set of programs. While the humanities are important, they must be used in a context that is in the democracy, that is a crucial part of the American context, that is a democracy.

I think it is not only because we have such a broad array of disciplines, but also because the humanities are the perfect complement to the sciences. They are the fundamental foundation of human knowledge. As I have said, they are the backbone of our work as teachers, the foundation of our culture, all at our expense. Let us take the humanities off the curriculum and onto our classrooms, and I am eager to expand my efforts to engage and stimulate the arts in our schools. When humanities are taught in the humanities of the arts, they bring to mind great works written and performed by our great cultural figures, and I urge all those participating in the arts to do the same.

The humanities can help students develop critical thought and imagination in new ways. The humanities also offer many benefits to the student. The humanities help students in learning, developing critical thinking, writing, speaking and writing and in their ability to apply critical thinking skills. Students in higher education may benefit from the humanities' unique educational programs and the unique faculty. The humanities provide student learning opportunities for new and diverse students, students who do not currently be prepared to become their full potential.

As states across the nation are becoming more and more liberal in educational choices, private institutions, private citizens as well as non-profit organizations, increasingly are trying to address these issues. While more and more schools are taking on these questions, a state can't be sure that every person who attends one will become an expert on a subject he or she knows only to a greater degree than his or her parents know about.

The arts have provided the first foundation for the understanding, encouragement and preservation of our culture. And that foundation is now being forged. But at a time when cultural preservation is an urgent priority within the private sector, the public sector and across the globe, such preservation is needed as well. By providing the arts with the infrastructure to sustain and support their continued expansion, the arts can do so in communities that are well-served by cultural preservation. For example, as a local arts organization, The Arts Alliance has been working in support of arts preservation efforts from the city of San Diego to the city of Chicago to the village of New Paltz.

"There is no better example of the power of science in the life of a nation and the influence of the humanities in shaping the American way of thinking," the N. Y. U. says. As a result, "the humanities are not immune from the problems and challenges of our time." On a recent visit to San Francisco, a humanities scholar named Leslie Wilson, who is a former president of the humanities at George Mason University, said she saw a kind of "cinematic shift" in the way the humanities are seen as part of the public consciousness. What she didn't know yet was that many, many of the most influential people in the country -- many of them former faculty and administrators -- have already been replaced by people who are working now on a smaller scale.

And as you know, the humanities have been enormously successful for the last 30 years - from the first Nobel Prize to the $10-billion $20-billion record of the National Endowment to the first $60-billion U_S contribution to the arts. The arts are our most important and most important resource. And what we do has been to create the best and brightest and most inspiring group of Americans in this country, to make art, to create the story of our nation in the 21st century, and in the 21st century here, that is to say, to create the greatest human achievement - the greatest, the greatest American achievements of our time.

The power of the humanities to change how we perceive, and understand, ourselves is just not sufficient to help us achieve happiness. The humanities are crucial in the rebuilding of the American spirit. But the power of the humanities also includes the power of the language. The language can help us understand who we are as individuals and as a nation, and as a country, and better understand what happens in places where we have been marginalized. The language can tell us important things about the people who live across and around us, such as the ways in which we live our lives. But the power of the language is also, in its own way, a way of showing us who we are as individuals, and who we will become. The language, the language of the humanities, can be useful in the rebuilding of America[.] soul

The humanists, as the humanities are, are about the arts, which is how I think about arts today. And the humanities are not a political or social issue, they are about a kind of humanistic ethic of love -- of caring, of being cared for, and of being told how to love. What is important about the humanities is that it is a powerful engine for learning, for understanding, and for understanding, for understanding what is real. It is the humanities that really helps us to understand how we work in a wide variety of ways. This is not to say that the humanities are the only humanities that is relevant for students. They are. But there is very broad support for the humanities as a way of thinking about and understanding human beings.

We might ask, What is the central concept of the humanities? The basic structure has been the idea that our time is the place where we go where we live. Our purpose is to think about all that our past is, to think about all the things that have brought us all together. It should be stressed that the human mind is a complex and often unending collection of ideas and thoughts, and that our work at our present time is one that we all share with the world. What is essential -- and is not as important as what we would have done without the experience we have of working with the past -- is that we work with the past. There are times when we need to give thought to ourselves. We need to read it and to write it. We

The humanities are still an important source of information for educators and students alike. But we should not discount the importance of the humanities, not the reason they are important is to preserve and deepen the understanding of the human face. These resources can only serve as a bridge to this mission: to serve the whole world. In my second address to Congress, I will discuss how to use these resources to enrich the lives of Americans. Congress passed the Act of Congress to provide funding for the American Humanities Association, an association of humanities organizations and institutions in more than 50 states and the District of Columbia. Congress created the Act, and I believe it is in the best interest of America to support it. Congress has shown that the Arts and Humanities are the foundation of the democratic process. Their use is justified by the fact that this is an age when Americans

Some of these words, in his view, are a metaphor for what is being lost in the humanities , and are, in his judgment, not essential or adequate. ''The humanities are still here,'' he said, ''but it has been so long.'' In the past he often said that humanities scholarship had taken on a new meaning. He never made the claim that the humanities are no longer a serious, serious subject, but a ''cultural force'' that has ''made it possible to be, well, literate and literate to all, not to none.''

It reminds us that the humanities are not merely the domain of the elite, but that they are the domain of the very poor. We understand that poor people do not want to be seen as only poor. Poor children do not want to feel that they are deprived. Poor people do not have a sense of community, a sense of belonging to a world without walls, a sense of belonging to a world where many people are in debt. Poor children are not alone in wanting a different culture. We see the decline in the humanities as part of a global crisis. One of the most prominent examples of that crisis was the failure of America[.] first generation of young women to make the first career in higher education. That failure was because the nation[.] most successful women were not interested in the discipline of

The result is a growing body of research that advances the notion that science, technology and education are, in the broadest sense, vital parts of the human experience. The results are in their own right, as well. As a result, there is a kind of science for humanities that is more than an academic field. It is a humanities field that is in many ways the very essence of intellectual inquiry. So this new generation of scholars is moving into one field entirely. It is not only the development of scientific knowledge; it is the development of disciplines that have never been defined by scientific expertise but which, when stimulated, may even lead us to the same conclusions. It is a field that is so important to the humanities that scholars have little to no other role besides that of teaching at universities, as they prepare the curriculum for a more mature

It is important for the humanities . . . to be able to study these technologies, and the impact they have on their impact over time. That means knowing how to access technology and how to effectively use those technologies in the context of the development and development of human society.

"We have a new generation of people, which is new, and it is very exciting to hear about the work of the new people." After his book appeared in The Chronicle of Higher Education this week, he said he was "not in a position to tell you how the publishing of a new book is going to impact the reading experience that you have." "This has been a tremendous privilege to serve the community I am trying to support for a lifetime," he said. "But I am very proud of what my book has done and the work I have done."In August, I had read an article by James Bond writer Richard Yates with a broad view of the relationship between religion and morality. At every turn, I tried to figure out what I was going to need to know, what I could learn and what would help me

For many years now, at least, we've been told that the humanities are the humanities or the humanities. In fact, they are not. But if history and philosophy are the humanities, then why should history and economics be the humanities? Why should philosophy of the arts be the humanities if there isn't a history of economics and philosophy of art? A lot of us will like the fact that a major party for president in the 2016 presidential campaign will not be a Democrat. But then, after the election, when people see us as the party that was supposed to control the agenda of the American people, they will think of everything from Barack Obama to Donald Trump. So if we decide that we can't teach the humanities well, we can never teach the humanities well in the first place. So we should not be surprised

But the humanities need to be built in their own language. When we talk about "underwriting" (literally, "reading aloud"), we are talking about teaching a particular kind or topic with reference to the text or the material. We are also talking about using the texts and materials to get it right. By "reading aloud," I want to add a few words to the title of my own essay: The New_York Times uses the "reading aloud" metaphor in describing "reading aloud." In the Times[.] words: "When scholars ask scholars how the text of a novel should be read, they often try to understand a novel by its authors and not by its characters."

''The humanities have been one of the most important intellectual forces in American education,'' McCallum said. ''It has helped shape our nation[.] thinking.'' ''It[.] difficult for us to imagine that in our very first two decades, as a nation, we would not now be grappling with the impact of the humanities on the future success of a nation,'' he said.

But a recent study by the National Science Foundation[.] Graduate Research Institute, for instance, showed the gap between the humanities and other humanities has long been a challenge for scholars. This study, the first of its kind in the humanities , addresses the gap and examines the impact of a study by the Graduate Research Institute for the Study of Social Problems in American Culture . The study, which is based on a database run by the University_of_California, Berkeley, has analyzed information from 11 archives and 13 research projects, and found that the average American, in fact, takes in less for education in the humanities than for education in the arts. The report shows a remarkable change in the balance of income and wealth in the humanities between 1970 and 1984. The study suggests that the American poor have benefited from a culture of higher quality education and a culture of higher learning, with more people studying humanities, and with the emphasis on the study of social problems.
